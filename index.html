									</header>
									<p>
                                        I'm Caio, born and raised in Brazil. 
                                        I'm passionate about learning and applying knowledge 
                                        in practical ways. Authentic and results-driven, 
                                        I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy 
                                        meeting new people. My love for technology, 
                                        cultivated since childhood through video games, 
                                        led me to a career in programming. Proficient in 
                                        various technologies, my expertise lies in Python, 
                                        where I create impressive websites and analyze complex 
                                        datasets. In my free time, I indulge in reading, 
                                        spanning from literary to technical genresâ€”no matter what, 
                                        I simply love to read.

									<h3>A Few Accomplishments</h3>
									<p> 
                                        My expertise in web development extends to advanced backend development, 
                                        employing the Python Django framework and MySQL database. 
                                        I proficiently utilize HTML and CSS to craft dynamic interfaces 
                                        and effectively implement Bootstrap for creating aesthetically pleasing designs.
                                        In the realm of data analysis, I am adept at using Pandas and NumPy to 
                                        analyze complex datasets. I leverage various libraries like Matplotlib, 
                                        Plotly, and Seaborn to generate dynamic and insightful plots. Furthermore,
                                        my proficiency in MySQL enables me to formulate robust queries, 
                                        facilitating the extraction and creation of reports 
                                        on vast and intricate datasets.

                                                    This project has been specifically devised for the meticulous 
                                                    analysis and retrieval of data from an extensive dataset 
                                                    stored in a CSV file. It strategically utilizes the Pandas 
                                                    library to cleanse, analyze, and extract pertinent information,

                                                    the application of the Matplotlib and Plotly libraries. 
                                                    Noteworthy is the automated dissemination of these plots
